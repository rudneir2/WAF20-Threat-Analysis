## Introduction / Use case

**NOTE**:
This chapter is not about the security solutions that Microsoft has available to protect your environment against Threats, such as M365 Defender solutions.

**Threat analysis** will present to you with some best practices that will help you identify threats, attacks, vulnerabilities and countermeasures during the design phase.

In this use case, we are considering an IT environment, the reference presented in the chapter "Baseline" (add a link here) with some workloads, components and personas that will help you understand all the recommendations in this chapter, regarding **Threat Analysis**.

As we may consider any type of solution development into the **threat analysis** model, such as applications, databases and others services available in the cloud, we may consider different components and workloads as examples, that is the reason we have below a common IT environment with some components explained below.
